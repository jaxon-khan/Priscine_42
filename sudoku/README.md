1. Create a program that resolves a sudoku.
2. A valid sudoku has only one possible solution.
3. Here’s how we’ll launch your program :

   > ./rush-1  line0  line1  line2  line3  line4  line5  line6  line7  line8

   LineN represents a characters string of values ranged between ’1’ and ’9’ or ’.’ (for empty boxes).

4. Here’s an example of intended input/output for a valid sudoku.

   > ./rush-1 line0 line1 line2 line3 line4 line5 line6 line7 line8
